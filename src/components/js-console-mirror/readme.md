# JS Console Mirror

JS Console Mirror is a web component built with Stencil that provides a virtual JavaScript console to mirror console output on the HTML page. It's particularly useful for testing web applications in mobile browsers, allowing you to see console output directly within the application UI.

## Features

- **Console Output Mirroring:** Capture and display `console.log`, `console.error`, `console.warn`, `console.info`, and `console.debug` messages within the component.
- **Customizable Styles:** Easily customize the appearance of the console output using CSS variables.
- **Framework Integration:** Can be integrated into any web application, including Angular, React, Vue, and plain HTML/JavaScript.
